# Container File Syntax

Container files are written in a very simple meta language.

## Types

The language supports the following scalar types:

 * **Strings** Single and double quoted. <br>
   `'hello'` & `"world"`
 * **Numbers** float / double, int. <br>
    `3.14`, `42`
 * **Booleans** <br>
     `true` and `false`.
 * **Null** <br>
    `null`
 * **Arrays** list and associative. <br>
   `{'A', 'B', 'C'}`, `{'A': 10, 'B': 20}`

### Numbers

Container files do not differentiate between different number types because it would be an unnecessary overhead, we forward that job directly to PHP.

```
42 # Int
42.01 # Float
-42.12345678912345 # Double
```

That means that also the floating point precision is handled by PHP. All values are interpreted means large doubles might be stored rounded.

### Strings

Strings must always be encapsulated with a single `'` or double `"` quote. This serves mainly a comfort purpose when having many quotes inside your string not having to escape them all.

Escaping of special characters works just the usual way. 

```
:say: 'Hello it\'s me!'`
```

Beloved or Hated emojis will also work just fine. 

```
:snails: 'üêåüêåüêå'
```

### Booleans and Null

There is not much to say about them:

```
:nothing: null
```

```
:positive: true
:negative: false
```

### Arrays

It's important to notice that all arrays are internally associative. When defining a simple list the associative key is automatically generated and represents the index of the item.

This means that the array `{'A', 'B'}` equals `{0: 'A', 1: 'B'}`.

Arrays can be defined multidimensional:

```yml
{
    'title': 'Some catchy title with Star Wars',
    'tags': {'top10', 'movies', 'space'},
    'body': 'Lorem ipsum ...',
    'comments': 
    {
        {
            'text': 'Awesome!',
            'by': 'Some Dude',
        }
    }
}
```

## Parameters

Parameters or configuration values can also be defined inside the container files. 

A parameter is always prefixed with a `:` character.

```yml
:database.hostname: "production.db.example.com"
:database.port: 7878
:database.cache: true
```

## Service Definition

A service definition is always named and must be prefixed with a `@` character. 

```yml
# <service name>: <class name>
@log.adapter: FileAdapter
```

The class name can contain the full namespace.

```yml
@log.adapter: Acme\Log\FileAdapter
```
### Constructor

Constructor arguments can be passed after the class name. 

```yml
@dude: Person("Jeffery Lebowski")
```

#### Referenced arguments

Arguments can reference a parameter or service.

```yml
:name: 'Jeffery Lebowski'

@dude: Person(:name)
```

```yml
@mysql: MySQLAdapter('localhost', 'root', '')

@repository.posts: Repositories/Post(@mysql);
```

### Method calls

Method calls can be assigned to a service definition.

```yml
@jones: Person('Duncan Jones')
@sam: Person('Sam Rockwell')

@movie.moon: Movie('Moon')
  - setDirector(@jones)
  - addCast(@sam)
  - setTags({'Sci-fi', 'Space'})
```

## Imports

Other container files can be imported from the container namespace.

```yml
import config
import app/dashboard
import app/user
import app/shop
```

## Overriding 

Services and Parameters have been explicit overwritten if they have already been defined.

```
:ship: 'Star Destroyer'

override :ship: 'X-Wing'
```
